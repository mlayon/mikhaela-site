            Hello, kumusta!
            <br />
            I think this is a beginning of a good thing, and I'd love to hear
            more from you.
            <br />
            Tell me your favorite memes, quiz me on trivias about The Office, or
            suggest shows and movies for me to watch.
            <br />
            I'm currently looking for new opportunities so feel free to email
            me, or just say hi below!
            
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>
