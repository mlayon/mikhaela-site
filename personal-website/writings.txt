Intro: 
Hello I'm Mikhaela,
I'm a software development student based in Vancouver, BC specializing in building websites,
applications and everything in between.

About Me:
Hi there, it's great to see you today.

I'm Mikhaela - a software development student based in Vancouver, BC. 

As a clumsy person who enjoys creating things, software development has been a great outlet for me.
My goal is to create an impact on the community by providing technical solutions and bringing people together.

Currently, I'm taking BCIT's Computer Systems Technology diploma program. During my time at BCIT,
I've been involved in the BCIT Women in Computing club, lending a hand on organizing events aimed to 
empower women and other minorities in the tech field.

Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:

Hello:

Hello, kumusta!

I think this is a beginning of a good thing, and I'd love to hear more from you.

Tell me your favorite memes, quiz me on trivias about The Office, or suggest animes and shows
for me to watch.

All kidding aside, feel free to email me, or say hi below.
